# Gaming shop database

## Index

## The Brief

The goal of this project was to create an OOP-based web-app using flask and other tools that have been introduced during the training. There should be at least two tables with full CRUD functionality

### Solution

I have created a database for a games store to store customer information and information about games in order to ensure things are more organised

Python- Coding

## Improvement for the Future

As of now the genre ID and game ID are what is being used to associate the tables with each other. Therefore to update the data like buyer ID and genre ID in the Games table. This means that the ID number of the games, genres and players must be known. I would like to change this in future sprints where the names can be used instead of IDs

I would also like to incorporate more tables into the web-app, that include a list of gaming companies and a list of platforms where the games are played and set up relationships between those tables and my currently existing tables.

A login system will be beneficial as this will increase the security of the system. It will ensure that only authorized personnel can operate the delete and update functions and helps prevent any theft of data. Along with this can be the introduction to admins and regular users that gives raise to different permissions and how each account type can interact with the app in different ways.
